# Cr3dX

**Verified cross-chain credit layer.** Money moves on Ethereum Sepolia. Credit
state lives on Creditcoin. The only thing that connects them is the Attestcoin
Protocol: no relayer, no oracle, no trusted backend.

Built for BUIDL CTC 2026 Fall, RWA track.

## What it does

Invoice financing is the first use case, not the product. A borrower opens a deal
against an invoice. A designated investor funds it in Sepolia, sending USDC
straight to the borrower with no escrow in between. Creditcoin learns that the
funding happened only when a proof of the Sepolia transaction passes through the
Attestcoin `BlockProver` precompile. Repayment works the same way in reverse, and
the credit outcome that follows is a consequence of proven facts rather than of
anyone's assertion.

The design separates two things that are usually conflated:

- **where value moves** - Sepolia, directly between the two parties;
- **where credit truth lives** - Creditcoin, as canonical state and history.

Take Attestcoin out and Cr3dX cannot tell whether a deal was funded, whether it
was repaid, or whether it came due. That is the test the integration is built to
pass.

## Trust boundary

Stated plainly, because a credit product that overstates its guarantees is worse
than one that has none.

**Proven cryptographically:** the funding transfer happened, the repayment
happened, the deadline passed, and the credit outcome follows from those facts.

**Not proven, and not claimed:** that the invoice is real, that the claim is
legally enforceable, or who the borrower is. *Invoice authenticity and legal
enforceability are outside the v0.1 trust boundary.*

**No enforcement.** There is no collateral and no escrow. The investor carries
the full risk of non-repayment; their protection is the borrower's reputational
record.

**No Sybil resistance.** *Cr3dX score is address-level verified repayment
reputation, not Sybil-resistant creditworthiness.*

## Networks

| Role | Network | Chain id |
|---|---|---|
| Credit layer, deployment target | Creditcoin3 Testnet | 102031 |
| Settlement, source chain | Ethereum Sepolia | 11155111 |

Sepolia's identifier inside Creditcoin is a `chainKey` assigned by the on-chain
registry, which is not the EVM chain id. It is resolved at runtime; see
[docs/ATTESTCOIN_INTEGRATION.md](docs/ATTESTCOIN_INTEGRATION.md).

## Repository layout

```
contracts/     Solidity sources (Sepolia gate, Creditcoin verifier, deals, credit)
scripts/       TypeScript tooling: network probe, deployment, demo driver
  lib/         shared clients for the precompiles and the proof builder
worker/        proof worker: watches the gate, waits for attestation, submits
docs/          specification, protocol reconnaissance, integration notes, status
data/probe/    raw measurement output, committed as evidence
```

## Setup

Requires Node.js 20 or newer.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vastargazing/Cr3dX.git
cd Cr3dX
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env` is git-ignored and is the only place credentials are ever read from. The
defaults in `.env.example` point at public endpoints and are enough to run the
probe, which is read-only and needs no key.

## Measuring the live network

Several protocol parameters are runtime state and cannot be read off the source:
the registry entry for Sepolia, how far attestation trails the source chain head,
and the real gas cost of a verification. The probe measures them against the live
testnet and writes the results into
[docs/ATTESTCOIN_INTEGRATION.md](docs/ATTESTCOIN_INTEGRATION.md).

```sh
npm run probe
```

The run takes about fifteen minutes, most of it sampling attestation lag. Raw
results land in `data/probe/`.

If your machine reaches the internet through a proxy, Node has to be told to use
it, otherwise every request fails as a network detection timeout:

```sh
NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 npm run probe
```

## Documentation

- [docs/cr3dx-spec-v0.4.0-final.md](docs/cr3dx-spec-v0.4.0-final.md) - the
  specification. Frozen; it changes only when the code proves it wrong.
- [docs/ATTESTCOIN_INTEGRATION.md](docs/ATTESTCOIN_INTEGRATION.md) - measured
  behaviour of the live protocol, and where it deviates from its documentation.
- [docs/PRECOMPILE_FINDINGS.md](docs/PRECOMPILE_FINDINGS.md) - reconnaissance of
  the protocol sources, with line references.
- [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) - running log of what works and what does not.

## Status

Network measurement complete. Contracts are next.
